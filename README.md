# COVID_DETECT_KERAS
This is a little homework with keras. I dont give the dataset in this repository, because I have not any license about the dataset. Therefore, I would tell you it comes from "Classification of COVID19 using Chext X-ray Images in Keras" in coursera

install the all lib that imported in the python file.
This is codes wroted by Windows10, if ran at Linux, they have some little changes.

Download it, and run model_structure.py

the main.py is used to predition new data, but it has not been checked to run successfully.
